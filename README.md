Title

Pixel Similarity-Based Adaptive Riesz Mean Filter for Salt-and-Pepper Noise Removal

Abstract

In this study, we propose a new method, i.e. Adaptive Riesz Mean Filter (ARmF), by operationalizing pixel similarity for salt-and-pepper noise (SPN) removal. Afterwards, we compare the results of ARmF, A New Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (AWMF), Different Applied Median Filter (DAMF), Noise Adaptive Fuzzy Switching Median Filter (NAFSMF), Based on Pixel Density Filter (BPDF), Modified Decision-Based Unsymmetric Trimmed Median Filter (MDBUTMF) and Decision-Based Algorithm (DBA) by using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Image Enhancement Factor (IEF), and Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) for 20 traditional test images (Lena, Cameraman, Barbara, Baboon, Peppers, Living Room, Lake, Plane, Hill, Pirate, Boat, House, Bridge, Elaine, Flintstones, Flower, Parrot, Dark-Haired Woman, Blonde Woman, and Einstein), 40 test images in the TESTIMAGES Database, and 200 RGB test images from the UC Berkeley Dataset ranging in noise density from 10% to 90%. Moreover, we compare the running time of these algorithms. These results show that ARmF outperforms the abovementioned methods. We finally discuss the need for further research
